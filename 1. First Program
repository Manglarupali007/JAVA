//java is platform independent- can run on any platform
//every java file is a class

public class First{
//we have to create a function in this class
public static void main(String[] args){ //same as int main in C/CPP
System.out.println("Hello World!"); //printing statement
}
}


//Explanation-
//public - accessible everywhere
//file name and class name should be same
//class name starts with capital letter


//static - method belongs to the class, not objects, so it can be called without creating an object.
// main function is entry point
// String[] args - This allows the program to accept command-line arguments as an array of Strings.


//system is class and out is variable
