//java is platform independent - can run on any platform
//every java file is a class

import java.util.Scanner;

public class First{
//we have to create a function in this class
public static void main(String[] args){ //same as int main in C/CPP
    System.out.println("Hey, How are you");
    Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in); //user input
System.out.println(input.nextLine()); //printing statement

input.close(); // Close scanner to avoid warning

}
}


//Explanation-
//public - accessible everywhere
//file name and class name should be same
//class name starts with capital letter


//static - method belongs to the class, not objects, so it can be called without creating an object.
// main function is entry point
// String[] args - This allows the program to accept command-line arguments as an array of Strings.


//system is class and out is variable


//User input
//Scanner is a class
//new is a keyword
//System.in refers to keyboard from where i am taking input
